          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>The Air Pollution Management project is not a complete Pollution Management module in itself. It is just a software that aims at keeping track of the level of pollutants released into the atmosphere. The calculation of the concentration of the various pollutants needs to be done manually, and the values need to be fed into the software as inputs. This software aims at keeping track of the amount of various pollutants that are released into the atmosphere.</p>

          <h2>Air Quality Index</h2>
          <p>An air quality index (AQI) is a number used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air is currently or how polluted it is forecast to become. As the AQI increases, an increasingly large percentage of the population is likely to experience increasingly severe adverse health effects.</p>

          <h2>Air Quality Health Index</h2>
          <p>The Air Quality Health Index or (AQHI) is a scale designed in Canada to help understand the impact of air quality on health. It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution. The Air Quality Health Index also provides advice on how to improve air quality by proposing behavioral change to reduce the environmental footprint. This index pays particular attention to people who are sensitive to air pollution. It provides them with advice on how to protect their health during air quality levels associated with low, moderate, high and very high health risks</p>
